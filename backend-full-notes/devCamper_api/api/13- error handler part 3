Error handler part 2


1-how to create a folder called utils in the root folder and inside
a file called errorResponse.


-which are the steps to create a class called errorResponse which extends
Error
-Has a contructuror method with message, and statusCode as parameters
-super takes a message as parameter too.

-initilize a property with:

this.statusCode = statusCode


how would you module.exports this file?

2-Go to the middleware error.js


how would you replace the res.status to have a parameter of err.statusCode || 500
and in the error: error.message || 'Server Error'


3-Go to the controllers folder ands import ErrorResponse = require('../utils/')


-Go into the get one bootcamp in the next function past

next(new ErrorResponse(`Bootcamp not found with id of ${req.params.id}`, 404))


How would you replace (in the same function the 400 response above for):

return new ErrorResponse(`Bootcamp not found with id of ${req.params.id}`, 404)
