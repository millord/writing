// using the map function to update

const updatedMealsDescription= updatedMeals.map(updateDescription)

// Create the function that will map each element searching
// for id 2

function updateDescription(meal){
  if(meal.id ===2){
    return{

2-HOW TO REMOVE AND ITEM FROM AN ARRAY IN AN INMUTABLE WAY WITH FILTER?

--function that determines what items to keep and what items to remove--


The return value of the filter function should be a boolean it will return 
true if you wish to include the item and false if you wish to excluded.


SO IF ITS NOT NUMBER WE WANT, WE WANT TO KEEP IT,
BUT IF IS NUMBER WANT, WE WILL REMOVE IT

NOTE:SO whatever evalutes to true you will keep it.

const filteredMeal = updatedMeal.filter((meal) =>{
  return meal.id !== 1;
})
console.log("THIS IS FILTERED MEALS: ",filteredMeal)
