1-Updating Objects part 2

now change it to:

const updatedMeal = {
   ...meal,
   description: "Brunch",
   calories: 600
}


console.log it.

 
We can add a new property and update a property.


2-Deleting a property

Combine distructuring and the ... operator


const {description, calories} = updatedMeal


removing the id


const {id, ...mealWithoutId} = updatedMeal;

pulling the id out (every property ecept the id)

console.log(mealWithoutId)
