1-Updating Objects


State: is the thing that your program remember.



Update without mutate

const meal = {
    id: 1,
    description: "Breakfast"

}

how to add a calorie to it?

const updatedMeal = {
    id: meal.id,
    description: meail.description,
    calories: 600
}

console.log(meal, updatedMeal)

--test it--

But a pretty dirty way of doing it

Better way using the spread operator ...

The properties of the old object are injected in the new.

const updatedMeal = {
    ...meal,
    calories:600
}

console.log(meal, updatedMeal)
