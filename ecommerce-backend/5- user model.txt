User model


1-create a new folder called models and inside a file
called user.js


require mongoose
require crypto
const uuidv1 = require("uuid/v1");


2-What are the steps to create an schema called userSchema with fields:

name:,String, trim:true, required:true, maxlength:32
copy the fields for email
but give it unique: true

3-copy the same fields for password too BUT--

you are not going to save the password but the hashed version of it and for that is use a virtual field:

hashed_pasword:{
    type:String,
    required: true

}  

-add a about field with the values of name but remove the trim, required and unique.

-add the salt field:

salt: String (only that)

- role:

type:Number, default: 0

-history field with:

type:Array
default:[]

and:
date: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
