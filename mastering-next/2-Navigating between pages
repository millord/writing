1-create the Header.js, Home.js , About, Contacts.js files into pages


Start with Home

create a functional component return the <Header/> Component and below
<h1>Welcome to Mastering Nex.js</h1>

-Create the Header component

create a functional component return a <header></header>

Having inside an ul with three  li having inside the Link imported from next/link
  and inside an a tag with the words Home, Contact, About

 <li>
  <Link href="/">
   <a>Home</a>
   </Link>
</li>


Create the About and Contact pages in the same way of Home.


3-Navigate throught links (It will do it really fast)

4-Dinamic Routing


inside pages create a folder called post:

inside it, create a new folder and use brackets to tell next that is a variable it will pass in:

[id] == name of the folder

and inside that folder add an index.js


-inside the index.js copy the code from about and import 
{useRouter} from 'next/router'


and create a Post component


const Post = () => {
  const router = useRouter()
  const {id} = router.query

  return (
    <>
    <Header/>
    <h1>Post: {id}</h1>
    </>
  )
}


export default Post


IMPORTANT ===> SO now we have access to all the routes
and we will grab the id from that router.
So when you navegate to this page the next router will pull that id
I will be able to access it.

See the video on minutes 6:25 to see how he added the id to the links

 <li>
 <Link href="/contacts">
 <a>Contacts</a>
 </Link>
 </li>
 <li>
 <Link as="/post/first-post" href="/post/[id]">
 <a>About</a>
 </Link>
 </li>
 <li>
 <Link as="/post/first-second" href="/post/[id]">
   <a>Contacts</a>
   </Link>
</li>
