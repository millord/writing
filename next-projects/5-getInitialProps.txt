Inside the Home (/pages/index.js). Which is a class based component


getInitialProps is from Next.js not react.
and it its called before the constructor is called

How to use it?

at the beginning(where the constructor should be):

and start with the keyword static

==IMPORTANT == must return and object

static getInitialProps(){
  console.log('initial props')
  return {}
}

// and go check in the terminal


== IMPORTANT == when using next.js your code runs first in the server and later in the browser.

==WHERE TO USE THE getInitialProps? ==

fetching data from a API (good case use)

Do this first:

static getInitialProps(){
  console.log('initial props')
  return {
    user:{
      name:'juan',
      lastname: 'millord'
    }
  }
}

Now the user object is available in props

-go below the render() and :

console.log(this.props.user)

TEST IT

CHECK THE CONSOLE

Now add it in the constructor:


constructor(props){
  super(props)
  this.state = {
    user: this.props.user
  }
}

so you can access it using this.state
