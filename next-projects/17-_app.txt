1-Go to the next.js docs and search for app and copy the contents

-inside the pages create _app.js

-and copy the content

--test it-- it should in the same way --


// you get access from the __app.js to all the data in the whole app

so, go inside the render of the __app.js and :

console.log(pageProps)


--test it-- you should be able to see the data in the console.log


==IMPORTANT== _app.js is the first component that is render.

now, go inside the render again and create an object:

newCar = {
 brand: 'ford',
 color: 'red'
}

- and pass it down to the component (SO ALL COMPONENTS WILL HAVE THAT DATA)

<Component {...pageProps}/>

--Go into the about componet and try to access it.
