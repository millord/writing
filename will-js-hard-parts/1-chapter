1-what happens when javascript runs?
When JavaScript code runs, it:

Goes through the code line-by-line and runs each line

-Saves data like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its memory

code---

const num = 3;

function multiplyBy2(inputNumber) {
  const result = inputNumber * 2;
  return result;
}

const output = multiplyBy2(num);
const newOutput = multiplyBy2(10);

JavaScript keeps track of what function
