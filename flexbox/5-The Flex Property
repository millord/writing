Learn about the flex property that allows to set width of items
according to the width of the entire container. Meaning they will
become responsive.

If we want all of the items to stretch across the entire container and grow and shrink with it. We just target the items with:

and select all the direct children with >

.container >  div{
  flex:1;	
}

The will take an equal amount of space.

Add a new item into the nav to see that it will take it

<div>Profile</div>


If we want the search item to be twice as big as the rest of the items:

.container > .search {
  flex: 2;
}

A more realistic approve would be that one item do all the flexing and the others stays at a fixed width.

We can do that by removing this:

.container > div {
  flex: 1;
  
  /*flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis */
}

and keeping this:


.search {
  flex: 2;
}
