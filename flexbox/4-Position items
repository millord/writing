How to abjust the position of a single item alogn the main axis  
(X) using the technique margin auto

Moving the logout item all the way to the right hand side

for that first give a classe to all three items

home = class home
search = class search
logout = class logout

to target the logout item

.logout{
  margin-left: auto;
}

it will push the logout item all the way to the left hand side

Now, it I want both the search and logout item to go to the left
just works with the .search class and both will go to the right side

.search{
  margin-left: auto;
}

as the search is before the logout in the markup it will push the logout as well to the right hand side.


Now change the code to this:

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}

all the items are in the right side:

move only the home to the left side.

.home {
  margin-right: auto
}
