The default is flux-direction row

just add flex-direction: column;

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}


If you try to add justify-content: flex-end

It wont do anything:

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-end;
}


This is because the height of the container is not set explicitely
is just as tall as the items inside. It has not extra space.


for that you have to explicitely set the height to 100%:

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  height: 100%;
}

IMPORTANT: If you set the height in the container to 100% you also have to do it in the html and body element of the file.


If you change the flex-end to flext start. It will stack them at the top. If  you also add center, It will center them.

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100%;
}


If you want to send the items to the right side add:


align-items: flex-end

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100%;
  align-items: flex-end;
}

Place the items in the right bottom corner:

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  height: 100%;
  align-items: flex-end;
}
