Start  with this code:


.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
}

.home {
  flex: 1;
}

.logout {
  flex: 1;
}


Only containing two items:


<body>
   <div class="container">
   <div class="home">Home</div>
   <div class="logout">Logout</div>
   </div>
</body>



1-Work with the flex-basis

-flex basis is a way of setting the base width of the element so 
they will stay at 200px not matter how much extra space there is
in the container.

Test it.

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
}

.home {
  /*
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  */
  flex-basis: 200px;
  
}

.logout {
    /*
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  */
  flex-basis: 200px;
}


2-flex-grow:


flex-grow  === grows with the width of the container. It fills 
with the remaining space.


.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
}

.home {
  /*
  flex-shrink: 1;
  */
  flex-grow: 1;

  flex-basis: 200px;
  
}

.logout {
    /*
  flex-shrink: 1;
  */
  flex-grow: 1;

  flex-basis: 200px;
}


Setting flex-grow to 0:

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
}

.home {
  /*
  flex-shrink: 1;
  */
  flex-grow: 0;

  flex-basis: 200px;
  
}

.logout {
    /*
  flex-shrink: 1;
  */
  flex-grow: 0;

  flex-basis: 200px;
}


As long as the two values are the same it will fit the space
evenly:



.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
}

.home {
  /*
  flex-shrink: 1;
  */
  flex-grow: 1;

  flex-basis: 200px;
  
}

.logout {
    /*
  flex-shrink: 1;
  */
  flex-grow: 1;

  flex-basis: 200px;
}


--- Try increasing the value of the logout from 1 - 5


3-flex-shrink

by giving a higher value to .logout and give the value
of 0 to .home the behavior is:

when you get to the maximum width the .logout will do all the shrinking while the home stays at 200px.

Play around changing the value of home to flex-shink:5

Change it to the desire behavior:

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
}

.home {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  flex-basis: 200px;
  
}

.logout {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  flex-basis: 200px;
}
