Justify content

from left to right

we are going to use a property called justify-content:

as thats the one that controls the content alogn the main
axis.

flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around
space-between, space-evenly

by default takes flex-start

flex-end == go to the end of the main axis

justify-content: center === it will center the items

space-around === it will give each item an equally amount of space

Try:

space-between and space-evenly and see the difference

space-between ====
