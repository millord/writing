1-Your first Flexbox layout


Creating a navbar:

<nav class="container">
  <div>Home</div>
  <div>Search</div>
   <div>Logout</div>
</nav>

Concept of container:

As long as they are direct children of the flex
container they become flex

Go into the index.css

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
}

by default they are stack, to change them to flex add:

display:flex

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display:flex;
}


And by default the flex box container is a block element.
