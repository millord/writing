All flex box container always have a direction
and by default is horizontal

so, it goes from left to right

Flipping the direction of a flexbox container


is you add flex-direction: row

nothing happends since is the default but,
if you do:

flex-direction:column

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

change it back to row
