Cards 

A nice way to display content

1-Simple card without a title

-create two divs, first with class of row and second with class col m6 s12 (2 coloumns of 6) 

-for creating the cards create two divs

-first class: card
-second class: card-content

2-Card with color

first div class: card red darken-2
second: card-content white-text

3-With Title

first div: class card
second class: card-content
to the span  (with the title) class of: card-title
below the content add to links in a div :
div class: card-action
that will work

4-With Image:

first div class: card
second: card-image (wrap and image in a img there)
below the image tag a span with class card-title
and in the content div class: class-content
-in the div below with the a link saying read more add a class of:
