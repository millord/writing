1- Show active link

to manually do it, just add and active prop:

<Menu.Item header active>

2-Do it dinamically:

we need to know what route we are currently on:

useRoute

import it from next/router


3-add it at the top

const router = userRouter()

Applying it conditionally:

create a helper function:

function isActive(router) {
    return router === router.pathname
  } 


add it to each menu item:

<Menu.Item header active={isActive('/')}>



4-Repeat it for all the links.

skip log out.
