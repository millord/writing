1-Go to Semantic UI React

We are going to use the startup files that came with the tutorial.


2-The links of the style sheets are on _App/Layout.js

3-We need a Header in each of our pages

How would you wrap the Layout into any component?

Next.js makes it easy using a costume page (in the page folder) called _app.

4-In the _app.js (inside pages) import Layout component.

wrap the Component (named Component) with the Layout component.

--TEST-- 


4-Adding the styles

Go to the Header component
-import the Menu component from sematic-ui-react

return the Menu component with opening and closing tags.
with props ==> fluid id="menu" inverted

<Menu fluid id="menu" inverted>


</Menu>

-import the Container component fron semantic-ui-react and add it inside the Menu with props ==> text
Like this:

function Header() {
  return (
    <Menu fluid id="menu" inverted>
      <Container text>

      </Container>
    </Menu>
  )
}

-Import the Link component from next/link
