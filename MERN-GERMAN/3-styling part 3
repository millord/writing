1-What links are shown for the authenticated and unauthenticated user:

based on hard-code user value

If we have a user we will show, the logout and account links otherwise we will show the Login and signup links.

using a ternary:

wrap in frament ==>  <> </>
from the Account link to Logout link

do the same for the Login and Signup link, so it will look like:


{user ? (<> account and Logout links </>) 

: 

(<> Login and Signup links </>) 

}

also if there is not user dont show the create link


{user && user link}
