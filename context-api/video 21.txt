--practice

localStorage.setItem("name", "juan")

localStorage.getItem("name")

Saving an object:

You cannot save object directly to localStorage, they have to be some kind
of string.

to save data in localStorage:

JSON.stringify()

to get it out:

JSON.parse()

So you can convert it back to an object.



4-Go inside the book context:

add the useEffect

-place it above the return and in the callback function.

 useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem("books", JSON.stringify(books));
  }, [books]);


add the books array to the localStorage

5-let it begin with the data of the localStorage

add a third argument to the useReducer function, which is a callback function.
Inside the body of that function:

const [books, dispatch] = useReducer(bookReducer, [], () => {
    const localData = localStorage.getItem("books");
    return localData ? JSON.parse(localData) : [];
  });
