10-update the onChange property of the firts input field.

onChange={(e) => setTitle(e.target.value)}

--- add a value property to the first input field:

value={title}

const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    console.log(title)

}

12- in the SongList component replace the hard code song title by just title.
(using distructuring)

AND PASS THE TITLE AS AN ARGUMENT to the addSong function

 13-pass the addSongs function in the SongList component to the NewSongForm component below:

<NewSongForm addSongs={addSong}/>

14-now in the NewSongForm accept it as a property:

const NewSongForm = ({addSongs}) => { 

15-update the handleSubmit function adding the:

addSongs(title)

16-use setTitle('') to clear after submiting the button.
