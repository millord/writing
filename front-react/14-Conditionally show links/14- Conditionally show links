Conditionally show 


1-Create a helper method in the auth/index

called the function:

export const isAuthenticated = () => {
  if (typeof window == "undefined") {
    return false;
  }
  if (localStorage.getItem("jwt")) {
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("jwt"));
  } else {
    return false;
  }
};

2-import this method into the Menu component.

3-If no authenticated we will show the signin and signup 

-cut the signup and signin links and put them into a block

{!isAutenticated && ( --<div>put the links here-- </div>)}

4- signout

cut it and put it into a block checking if isAuthenticated show the link:
{isAuthenticated() && (--put link here --)}

5-Fixing the style:

Wrap all the links into a Fragment.
