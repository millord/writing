Once the payment is done, we need to send the order information
to the backend and save it in the database, So the users can 
see the purchase history, and admin can see how many orders
, so they can process them.

1-Go to our backend to create a new route and controller.

2-there, create a route called order.js

-reuse all the braintree route.
-remove all the routes, I mean, all the router.get...,route.post...

-we are going to use the userById route.

-we need also the auth controllers also.

-remove the braintree controllers imports

and replace them by:

const {create} = require('../controllers/order')

3-create the route:

router.post('/order/create/:userId', requireSignin, isAuth, create)

4-import this route into the app.js file
-call it orderRoutes
-put it in the middlewares

5-go into the controllers folder and create the orders.js file

-So before we create new order and save it to the database we will
have a look in the console.

exports.create = (req, res) => {
  console.log('Create order:', req.body)
}
