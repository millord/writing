//1- Import the withRouter to access history

-import { withRouter} from 'react-router-dom' 

-Export the component with it: 

export default withRouter(Menu);


This is to acccess the history later


2-Conditionally highlighting the links.

const isActive = (history, path) => {
  if(history.location.pathname === path){
    return {color: "#ff9900"}
 } else {
     return {color: "#fffff"} 
   }
}

Add that function to the style property:

style={isActive(history, '/')}
