-- in the Search component

1-handleChange


const handleChange = (name) => (event) => {
  setData({ ...data, [name]: event.target.value, searched: false });
};





const searchSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  // call the searchData function which you will create above it
  searchData();
};

const searchData = () => {
  console.log(search, catetory)
}



searchData === will make the api request.


// Test it , select a category and search for a book and see it in the console

It should send you what you searched and the category



2-Go into apiCoreCopy and reuse a get method from the apiCore.js

and make some changes:

-name: list
-add as a parameter: params
-npm i query-string
-import it in apiCore as queryString
-create a const name query before calling fetch
const query = queryString.stringify(params)
-fetch the route is: `${API}/products?${query}`

The rest keep the same.
