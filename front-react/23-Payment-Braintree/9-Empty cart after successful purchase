Once the user pays for the product, we need to empty the cart for the 
localStorage.

1-Go into cartHelpers.js

-there, create a method that will clear out the items from the localStorage.

export const emptyCart = (next) => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    localStorage.removeItem("cart");
    next();
  }
};


2-Go into the Checkout component and import it.

-execute it  when we recieve the sucessfull payment, 
in the buy function, inside the processPayment function after
setting the data into the state.

setData({})...

processPayment(userId, token, paymentData).then((response) => {
          setData({ ...data, success: response.success });
          emptyCart(() => {
            console.log("Payment success and empty cart");
          });

emptyCart(() => {
 console.log('payment success and empty cart')
})


--TEST IT MAKING ANOTHER PURCHASE WITH THE FAKE CARD DATA.
