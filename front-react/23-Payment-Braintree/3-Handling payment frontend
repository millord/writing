1-Send the payment method and the total amount to the backend when the checkout button is clicked.


2-Go to Checkout
-In the button of showDropIn change from Checkout to Pay.
-When that button is clicked we need to execute a function

onClick={buy}

create the buy method on top of showDropIn


const buy = () => {
  // send the nonce to your server
  // nonce = data.instance.requestPaymentMethod()

  let nonce;
  let getNonce = data.instance
    .requestPaymentMethod()
    .then((data) => {
      console.log(data);
      nonce = data.nonce;
      // once you have nonce (card type, card number) send nonce as 'paymentMethodNonce'
      // and also total to be charged
      console.log(
        "send nonce and total to process: ",
        nonce,
        getTotal(products)
      );
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log("dropin error", error);
      setData({ ...data, error: error.message });
    });
};

// IF YOU GET AN ERROR SOMETHING UNDEFINED, go into the showDropIn method and
in onInstance change from only instance to data.instance
