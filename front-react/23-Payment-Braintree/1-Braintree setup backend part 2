1-install braintree

npm i braintree


2-go to routes and create a new file called:
-braintree.js

3-in that file create import the Router and export it

4-Create the first get route inside it

router.get('/braintree/getToken/:userId', )

5-appy some middlewares, go into user routes and reuse

autentication controllers methods, and paste them in braintree.js
-remove isAdmin middleware
-apply them to the route

router.get('/braintree/getToken/:userId',requireSignin, isAuth,  )

6-create a controller method to generate the token when we get a request to that route.

-call the controller: generateToken:

router.get('/braintree/getToken/:userId',requireSignin, isAuth, generateToken )

7-We need to get the route parameter:

--STILL ON braintree.js--

router.param('userId', userById)

8-To be able to use the userById:

reuse the user controller into braintree.js

const {userById} = require('../controllers/user')


9-Go to app.js and import this routes and called them:

braintreeRoutes from routes/braintree

-apply it as a middleware

10-In the controllers folder create braintree.js

-import it into routes/braintree.js

11- (INSIDE THE /controllers/braintree.js)

-import the User model
-require braintree package
-require dotenv


11- connect to braintree using the keys

const gateway = braintree.connect({
  environment: braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
  merchatId: process.env.BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID,
  publicKey: process.env.BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY,
  privateKey: process.env.BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY
})



12-create the generateToken function using gateway:

exports.generateToken = (req, res) => {
  gateway.clientToken.generate({}, function (err, response) {
    if (err) {
      res.status(500).send(err);
    } else {
      res.send(response);
    }
  });
};

13-trying to make a get request:
Go into insomnia
make a get request to:

-first, signin with a user so you can get the user id. Put it at the end of the request. Also, send the token in the request.

Content-Type : application/json
Authorization : Bearer token_here
