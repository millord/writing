-Implement the payment process in the front-end

1-go in the apiCore

add one more method
reuse the getBraintreeClientToken and do some changes:

call it:

processPayment
arguments:
-userId, token, paymentData
-fetch to: `${API}/braintree/payment/${userId}`
-method: POST
-keep the Accept, Content-Type and Authorization

In the body:

body: JSON.stringify(paymentData)

The rest keeps the same.

2-Move to the Checkout component

-import the processPayment

3-Go inside the buy method and instead of console.log:

console.log("send nonce and total to process", 
           nonce,  
          getTotal(products)
)    

comment that out, and add:
also comment out the other two console.log that are inside that function
type:

--THIS GOES BEFORE THE CATCH

const paymentData = {
  paymentMethodNonce: nonce,
  amount: getTotal(products),
};

processPayment(userId, token, paymentData)
  .then((response) => console.log(response))
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));

-- UNTIL HERE, THERE WILL BE USE TWO CATCH METHODS
4-Go into the button of the showDropIn function that says Pay and modify it with:

add btn-block


--TEST IT---

Enter the card number:

4111 1111 1111 1111     
exp: 11/22

Check the console.log, should give a success message, success true.
