1- Below of the showItems function create:

const noItemsMessage = () => {
  <h2>
    Your Cart is empty. <br />
    <Link to="/shop">Continue Shopping</Link>
  </h2>;
};

2-Now inside the Layout:

create a div with class col-6 (so we can show the products in half of the screen)

inside that div (left half ) write:

{items.length >  0 ? showItems(items) : noItemsMessage()}

3-Copy and past this div and copy below so you can get right side
remove of what that div has inside and add:

<p>Show checkout options/shipping address/total/update quantity</p>;

4-Import it the Routes.js
path="/cart"
