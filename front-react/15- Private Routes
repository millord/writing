1-go to the user folder and create the UserDashboard.js

-import the Layout component
-create a functional component

2-return the Layout passing:
title=User Dashboard
description="User Dashboard"
add ... inside


3-Go to the menu and create  link right after Home.
how do you add a link into the Menu component with Dashboard title.


--- IMPORTANT ---

create a new file inside auth called PrivateRoutes.js:


-We will create a functional component that will as a prop a component
and the rest of the props.

-before we return the route with apply the auth method if is authenticated
we send the component.


4-So go into the PrivateRoutes component and make a functinal component:

-import Route, Redirect from react-router-dom

-import the isAuthenticated user from auth index
if is authencated we grab the user from the localStorage.

const PrivateRoute = ({component: Component, ...rest}) =>(
  <Route {...rest} render={props => isAuthenticated() ? () : ()}/>
)

--take in the props the component, import it at the top:
Import React, {Component} from 'react'

then after acceting props you return a Route with the rest of th props,
after that use the render.

FINALLY:

const PrivateRoute = ({ component: Component, ...rest }) => (
  <Route
    {...rest}
    render={(props) =>
      isAuthenticated() ? (
        <Component {...props} />
      ) : (
        <Redirect
          to={{ pathname: "/signin", state: { from: props.location } }}
        />
      )
    }
  />
);


Note: If is authenticated you return the Component with the props if not you redirect.


4-export the PrivateRoutes.js
