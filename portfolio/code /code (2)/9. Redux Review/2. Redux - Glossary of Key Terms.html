<p>Here is a glossary of key terms related to redux, that you may use as a reference as you build React and Redux apps in the future.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Redux: </strong>A state management library that collects the data for a JavaScript application (most often a React app).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Store: </strong>An object which collects the data for the <em>entire </em>application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Reducers: </strong>Functions which describe how sections of the store should update. They respond to action objects, and take the information from certain actions to update their part of the store.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Actions</strong>: Plain objects which go through the redux system, that trigger reducers. They must have a `type` field, so that they can be identified by reducers. Actions will contain payloads of information that reducers can use.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Action creators</strong>: Functions that generate action objects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>connect()</strong>:<strong> </strong>A function from the react-redux module which allows you to make the connection between the redux store and a React component. This returns a function itself, the “componentConnector”, in which you pass the actual component name.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>mapStateToProps</strong>: The first argument to the connect function. Allows you to specify what data the component should have from the redux store. You map the redux store state to the props object of the component.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>mapDispatchToProps</strong>: The second argument to the connect function. Allows you to specify what methods should be made available to the component (through props), that will be able to dispatch the results of action creators to the store.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Async actions</strong>:<strong> </strong>Asynchronous actions are ones that don’t immediately return action objects. They can have functionality that calls the dispatch method at various places. For example, an async action, wrapped around a fetch, can call dispatch for a successful fetch using the resulting json, or call dispatch for a failed fetch using the error object.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Redux middleware</strong>: Code that runs in between the point an action gets dispatched, and that action reaches the redux reducers.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thunk</strong>: Redux middleware designed to support asynchronous actions. This middleware will hold onto the redux dispatch method, and call dispatch once the data from an async action is ready to be dispatched.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>combineReducers()</strong>: A function which can take multiple reducer functions and combine them into one overall reducer function.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Same-origin Policy and CORS</strong>: The same-origin policy is a check that the browser implements to ensure that your code isn’t making fetches to unknown origins. Only servers that allow your frontend address as an origin can pass the same origin policy. This concept is also known as CORS (cross-origin resource sharing), which is the mechanism which enforces the matching of origins between the browser client and server.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Local Storage</strong>: A key-value structure provided by the browser to store items of information across browser sessions. Don’t store sensitive info in local storage! The storage data is accessible by any web application on the browser.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pub/Sub</strong>: A software pattern that allows publishers to send information to channels that subscribers will listen to. A good networking option that can reduce the usual approach of keeping a list of all addresses that are connected to the network.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>React Context</strong>: A way to share data between many React components without having to pass that data down manually through props. A component will look to the nearest parent component, that is a context Provider, to get the values that it can use for its own component `context` field.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Redux Devtools</strong>: A great browser extension that allows you to read your redux store’s state at any moment, and see the types of dispatching actions in real-time. <a href="https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension</a>.</p>
