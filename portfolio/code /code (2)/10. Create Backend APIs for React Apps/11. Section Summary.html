<p>üçæ</p><p>Woohoo! Nice work on completing this section on setting up backend APIs. With the ability to create custom APIs and wrappers in your toolbelt, you‚Äôll be able to quickly add content to any React projects you create in the future!</p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>Here‚Äôs a highlight reel the main concepts and lessons from this section:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Express </strong>is a framework built on top of Node.js used for starting servers and building web APIs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Express middleware</strong> is functionality that runs before every request, to process information about the request, add headers to the response, perform logging, and any other kind of useful functionality.</p></li><li><p><strong>CORS:</strong> Adding the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with the `*` argument will allow any frontend addresses to be considered as part of the server‚Äôs origin. This helps get past the same origin policy check implemented by the browser.</p></li><li><p><strong>API Wrappers </strong>are servers that perform inner requests to other APIs. These can be used to combine multiple API requests into one overall request, to add a more open `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, and to accomplish other custom functionality!</p></li><li><p><strong>Serving a React Frontend </strong>can occur within the same server as its backend API. Serve a static directory to the relative path where your React code is built.</p></li><li><p><br></p></li></ul><p>*****</p><p>You‚Äôre approaching the end of the course! Here‚Äôs how your progress in the course looks:</p><p><img height="275" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HfC8Db5qVIj4SEgKc7m4Kw5oWqfhOaipPHynXp2ObYzV4QtL8RNwvTxJ-1GX0_yff97jyOy5mbt9a27jqXmFFeSuqwXBckqv7vaDdexgsM3XKvFdIQT9jfR3Hj_UCU7ooygnTw33" width="447"></p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>In the next section, you‚Äôll deploy the React applications you built. Think of it as a mini celebration of all you built so far. After all, you‚Äôll get a public address for the world to use to access your portfolio, and React apps. It‚Äôs also the final section of the overall course, so you‚Äôre nearly done with this React and Redux bootcamp! Congrats on making it this far! Get a drink, snack, nap, or whatever you need to stay strong as you head to the course finish line!</p>
