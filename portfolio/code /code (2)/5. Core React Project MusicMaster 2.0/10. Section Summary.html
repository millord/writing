<p>üèÜ</p><p>Another section completed! Excellent work! Now‚Äôs a good time for a coding break :)</p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>In this section, you built <strong>MusicMaster </strong>- an application that hits the Spotify API to get a playable list of the top tracks of any artist. There were a few key topics that appeared while building MusicMaster:</p><ul><li><p><strong>You now have your own React-app-template and create-react-app alternative. </strong>With the react-app-template directory, you can bootstrap a React project in under a minute!</p></li><li><p><strong>User input can be tracked with the `onChange` property</strong>. The onChange will pass an event object to a callback function. This contains an `event.target.value` to represent what the user typed into the input element.</p></li></ul><p>In addition, another main goal of this section was to get more practice with the core React concepts. That way, you‚Äôre fully prepared to move onto Redux!</p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>Check out your progress with this section done!</p><p><img height="355" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uPxIV9D9sGIqZP8j0YWabfnpTepYBTD_rpSrB9mPzoG7eYfcCJ9LOU7JGFkyJlsbiw5Cv8logjtiTTAAPoXKYo8BlKII1mPD5h_orbwU8oh0lV4mYVo9AqMVoNWPPGBUTY8NTYzu" width="595"></p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>The next section begins the exploration of Redux. This technology is a must for any advanced React application. And within the next few videos, you‚Äôll find out why!</p>
