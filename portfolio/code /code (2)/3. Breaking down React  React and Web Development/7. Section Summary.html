<p>ðŸ’¯</p><p><br></p><p>Great work on completing this section! Like before, feel free to take a coding break to get some rest before the next section. Or, dive right into the next section! This course is in your hands.</p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>In the meantime, letâ€™s go over the topics that got covered in this section:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You focused on breaking down React, and Reactâ€™s relationship with web development overall. </strong>In that process, you uncovered some major concepts that all React developers should understand:</p><ul><li><p><strong>There are three core pillars to a web application</strong>: html, css, and JavaScript. React.js exists in the JavaScript layer of a web application.</p></li><li><p><strong>The client-server architecture </strong>describes the relationship between a client requesting the documents for a web app (html, css, js) from a server computer that can respond with them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bundling </strong>is the process of taking many JavaScript files and combining them into one giant JavaScript file for the html to refer to. This is useful because the browser doesnâ€™t natively support the import/export system that is used in React projects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parcel-bundler </strong>is a tool that achieves bundling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transpiling </strong>is the process of translating modern JavaScript code into a syntax that the browser actually supports. This is necessary because, as the JavaScript language evolves and adds new features, the browser must keep up and support those additions. Therefore, the feature set that the browser can support will always be a bit behind the overall JavaScript language.</p></li><li><p><strong>Babel </strong>is a tool that achieves transpilation.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>After completing this section, hereâ€™s your progress in this course so far:</p><p><br></p><p><img height="320" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9vh76oCbVipxpNOuFbeYcb-_SAx9O5THdDRN5nMGge65fUvctgvCqKYEL6AxrDe--jFTM1_9Hbcr9IEfx1XvhXbUuRCihQqx5elH1N24Zjalx496OH9eXHCoQf8iE_ShMzEOx73o" width="518"></p><p>*****</p><p>With this section done, a lot of the groundwork has been completed for exploring React. You now have a solid foundation of React coding (components, state, and props), and a big picture perspective of how it fits in web development overall. Next, youâ€™ll continue focusing on core concepts of React - exploring methods and techniques that you would see in any React application - fetching, routing, higher order components, and more. So get ready to dive even more deeply into React!</p>
