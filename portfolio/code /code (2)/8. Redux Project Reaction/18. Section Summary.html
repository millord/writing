<p>üèÖ</p><p>Really nice work on completing the second React and Redux section! Redux can be a challenging topic. But now that you‚Äôve created two full React and Redux applications, I hope you feel ready to tackle your own projects.</p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>As usual, this summary will highlight the main concepts and lessons from this section. In this one, you created the <strong>Reaction </strong>application. This app is a multi-user application that allows people to post publish messages and react to them with emojis!</p><p>This section introduced quite a few new topics:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pub/Sub </strong>is a pattern that enables communication in a network based on publishing messages to channels, and subscribing to those messages.</p></li><li><p><strong>React context </strong>is a way to share data between many components, without having to manually pass objects down through props.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Context</strong> <strong>Provider Component</strong> uses a <strong>value property </strong>to provide data to any nested component through its <strong>context </strong>field.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Redux devtools </strong>is an extension that allows you to examine the redux store state, and see actions being dispatched in real time.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>You‚Äôve made a lot of progress in the course!</p><p><br></p><p><img height="367" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zmSSLkRFTpRRsmEEHaXCxtEoRak12vFgbQX-4UFCHaOIUU7wGpi7JtLWQyPZQdlt_BoVPd3E12iP0AZNpQBSKSW_GIggBYFNVSgxs4VoWp1sCx3PMf5DxmX4J3FcMlVqSDCCPzZS" width="594"></p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>In the next section, you‚Äôll learn how to create the backend APIs for React applications. The idea is to learn the fundamentals so that you know enough backend to be dangerous. That way, you can create APIs to power the data for any React projects you want to make in the future!</p><p>The main project of the next section will be building an API around the top stories from hacker news - a platform near and dear to the heart of any software engineer. Also, you‚Äôll discover how the spotify and deck-of-cards api wrappers were built. Alright, see you there!</p>
