<p>üèÖ</p><p>Nice work on completing this section! As usual, feel free to take a coding break to get some rest before the next section.</p><p>*****</p><p>In the meantime, let‚Äôs go over the topics that got covered in this section:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You focused on completing a foundational knowledge of the React core concepts.</strong> With this section done, you should already be prepared to build complex React apps with lots of functionality. In this section, you learned about:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Using the fetch method to make API calls</strong>. With the fetch method, React app can make HTTP requests to API services. This is an excellent way to add a ton of new content to your React application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Applying routing to the application</strong>. With react-router, a single page React application can transform into one with multiple pages of different content. Each page matches a url path of the application to a different component.</p></li><li><p><strong>Using higher-order components. </strong>A higher-order component is one that takes another component as an input. The idea is to treat the component like a function. Have one component as input, and then output an entirely new component based on that input, with new properties, methods, and/or JSX!</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>Here‚Äôs your progress in the course after completing this section!</p><p><img height="345" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/0u3aCgciHTyDNl2E0V2ChoHIqaZNAswAkS0XXp53gdZBmDtDseERCReYWiQQS-KMEUcFNcllL834LEF0M0KnMGVGu_CFjnPTUPCFUFBndBdO49tOVNsqt78wMzmWmMDlYSXLA27O" width="569"></p><p>*****</p><p>With this section completed, I‚Äôm confident that you‚Äôll be ready to move on to redux. However, the next section is there to give you one more opportunity to apply these core concepts. For the most part, this section will be a bit of a review for the core React concepts. One new aspect is keeping track of user input within components. But overall, think of it as a bonus section for the core React concepts! The product of the next section is an application called Music Master. This application will allow you to search for the top tracks of any musician, and play a preview of their work.</p><p>Overall, the idea is to get practice with the core React concepts one more time, before graduating and taking on Redux. See you in the next one!</p>
