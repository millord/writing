<p>👏</p><p>Excellent work on completing this section! If you’d like to take a coding break, now is the perfect time to do so! Otherwise, let’s go over review what you did in this section.</p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>In this section, you created a full on React application: portfolio. Hopefully, you got a lot of value out of the application. You may even decide to build on top of it for your own personal website (hint: later on we’ll look at deploying the React app). And if not, you still covered quite a few important concepts while building it:</p><p><strong>Components: </strong>reusable pieces of React code to control part of the user interface. Components capture the structure of UI, and can have internal data to track the user behavior throughout the lifetime of the app.</p><p><strong>State: </strong>dynamic data in a React component. This is often used to track variables that will be re-rendered in the UI based on events that occur in the application.</p><p><strong>👉 Remember the React State Rule: Never Directly Modify State. </strong>Instead use the `this.setState` method.</p><p><strong>Props: </strong>data in a React component that gets passed down from its parent. In the parent component, it will pass data down to the child component through attributes in the child component’s JSX.</p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>With this first section completed, here’s your progress in the course fo far:</p><p><br></p><p><img height="373" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ebsTXhd1QHjaNasdtEGsRTcdSBPPkKLI4nqxahu2UVAuAJv6S8hGv_L_2A_koSG2RcKLs8h8L8_V0xLQvR5cRRCM1rQXC54dTSxmwGL8HA5wM2K6wI_UFORrOSZ69DHXwJJ8IMjN" width="599"></p><p><br></p><p>*****</p><p>Alright, I hope you’re excited to begin the next section. There, you’ll get that important big picture perspective of how React fits in web development overall. You’ll also break down React and attempt to bootstrap a React project from scratch. Furthermore, you’ll take a closer look at what’s going on under the hood with React. Lots of exciting content to look forward to!</p>
