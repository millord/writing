This problem deals witha  matrix which is a 2 dimentional array.

Normally what you would do is:

traversin or transforming the matrix

reverse() === works on any array (it mutate the array)

let rotate = function (matrix) {
  matrix.reverse();
  for (let i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      let temp = matrix[i][j];
      matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
      matrix[j][i] = temp;
    }
  }
};


Dont need to returns since its mutate the array
