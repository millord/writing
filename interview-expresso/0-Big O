Big O

Two types of Big O

1-Time complexity


a)Linear Time (doubling the input also double the time)
O(n)

B)Constant time(when the time and the space have not relation with the input )

O(1)

2-Space Complecity


Every line we code has a time complecity

and every variable we code has a space complexity


BEST CASE

We always take the worst case to evaluate an algorithm
